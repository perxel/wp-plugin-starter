Guidance for working on this repository.

## What this is

`perxel-example` - a **public** WordPress plugin (repo
`github.com/perxel/wp-example`, WordPress.org slug `perxel-example`,
published under the `phucbm` .org account, branded Perxel).

It was scaffolded from
[`perxel/wp-plugin-starter`](https://github.com/perxel/wp-plugin-starter). If
this file still says "perxel-example" / "PXEX" / "Example", the
template tokens have not been replaced yet - see the starter README.

## Layout

```
perxel-example.php      Main file: header, constants, autoloader, UI-kit loader, boot
uninstall.php               Deletes the option (and any custom tables) on delete
includes/*.php              One PSR-4-ish class per concern, namespace Perxel_Example\
includes/views/*.php        Dumb admin templates, fed vars by the screen classes
assets/css, assets/js       Admin-only CSS/JS (plugin-specific; layout comes from the kit)
vendor/perxel-ui/           Shared admin-UI kit - vendored, see below
languages/                  .pot template
readme.txt                  WordPress.org listing (keep in sync with README.md + version)
.wordpress-org/             Listing assets (icon, banner, screenshots) - not shipped
.github/workflows/          lint.yml (PHPCS + Plugin Check), release.yml
```

`includes/` is loaded by the `spl_autoload_register` in the main file (not
Composer). `Plugin::instance()->boot()` runs on `plugins_loaded` and wires
`Admin`.

## Architecture

- **`Plugin`** - singleton. `boot()` wires the admin surface; `activate()` is
  the activation hook (seed options, create tables).
- **`Admin`** - owns the menu (one `Tools ->` screen), the shared layout args,
  asset loading, and the plain-form / `admin-post` handlers. Each screen is a
  `render_*()` method + a view under `includes/views/`; heavier per-screen logic
  goes in its own class.
- **`Settings`** - the one option (`PXEX_OPTION_KEY`), read through typed
  accessors, written through `update()` / `sanitize()`. Never call
  `get_option()` for it directly elsewhere.

### Custom tables

The template ships none. When you add them:

- One `includes/Db.php` for schema (`dbDelta` on `Plugin::activate()`, a stored
  `pxex_db_version` option, `Db::maybe_upgrade()` on `init`), and one repository
  class that is the *only* code touching the tables.
- **Bind the table name with the `%i` placeholder - never concatenate it.**
  `%i` needs WP 6.2+ (the template's floor is already 6.5).

  ```php
  // Right:
  $wpdb->get_results(
      $wpdb->prepare( 'SELECT * FROM %i WHERE run_id = %d', Db::items(), $run_id ),
      ARRAY_A
  );
  // Wrong - WordPress.DB.PreparedSQL.NotPrepared (error-level, blocks .org):
  $wpdb->get_results( "SELECT * FROM {$table} WHERE run_id = {$run_id}" );
  ```

- A `SELECT` with only the table (no other args) still goes through
  `prepare()`: `$wpdb->prepare( 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM %i', Db::runs() )`.
- `DROP TABLE`: `$wpdb->prepare( 'DROP TABLE IF EXISTS %i', $table )`.
- Direct `$wpdb` on your own table is expected; annotate the call:
  `// phpcs:ignore WordPress.DB.DirectDatabaseQuery.DirectQuery, WordPress.DB.DirectDatabaseQuery.NoCaching -- <reason>`.
  `dbDelta()` CREATE and uninstall DROP add `WordPress.DB.DirectDatabaseQuery.SchemaChange`.
- A dynamic `IN (...)` list is the one case with no clean placeholder: build it
  with `implode( ', ', array_fill( 0, count( $ids ), '%d' ) )` and wrap that one
  statement in `// phpcs:disable ... WordPress.DB.PreparedSQL.InterpolatedNotPrepared, WordPress.DB.PreparedSQLPlaceholders.ReplacementsWrongNumber` / `// phpcs:enable`.
- Uncomment the `WordPress.DB.DirectDatabaseQuery` block in `phpcs.xml.dist`.
- Don't put a bare SQL keyword like `'create'` as a column *value* inside a
  `$wpdb->insert()`/`update()` call - PHPCS reads it as DDL. Assign it to a
  variable first.

## Conventions

- **Namespace** `Perxel_Example\` - the slug (`perxel-example`) in
  `Ucfirst_Snake` form, so `WordPress.NamingConventions.PrefixAllGlobals`
  accepts it as the plugin prefix (Plugin Check does not read `phpcs.xml.dist`,
  so a `Vendor\Package`-style namespace would be flagged there). Sub-namespaces
  are fine (`Perxel_Example\Admin\Foo` -> `includes/Admin/Foo.php`). Hooks,
  option keys and CSS classes stay `pxex_` / `pxex-`; constants `PXEX_`. Product
  name is the constant `PXEX_NAME` (no rebrand option).
- **Text domain** `perxel-example` (= the slug). JS i18n via `wp.i18n`
  (`wp_set_script_translations`); script deps include `wp-i18n`.
- **Escape at output.** Views set
  `// phpcs:disable WordPress.Security.EscapeOutput.OutputNotEscaped` because the
  kit escapes structure - every dynamic value is still escaped inline.
- Admin screens render inside `Perxel_UI_Layout::open()/close()` via
  `Admin::screen()`, which falls back to a plain notice if the kit is not
  vendored. Use the kit components (`rows()`, `notice()`, `toggle()`, `code()`,
  `meter()`, `progress_bar()`, `checkbox_group()`, `card()`) rather than
  hand-rolled markup. A bare `<input type="checkbox">` renders as a square box;
  the iOS switch is `Perxel_UI::toggle()` / the `.pxui-toggle` class. Figures
  (counts, totals) are a `rows()` group - label left, value as `content` right,
  `sub` for the qualifier, `tone` for good/warn/bad.
- Forms that can lose unsaved edits carry `data-pxui-dirty-guard` (kit >=
  0.20.0).

## The `vendor/perxel-ui/` kit

Standalone repo [`perxel/wp-plugin-ui`](https://github.com/perxel/wp-plugin-ui),
vendored via `bin/update-ui.sh <version>` (curl a tagged tarball into
`vendor/perxel-ui/`, Action Scheduler style - no Composer). Committed;
`.gitignore` keeps it out of the general `vendor/` ignore, `.distignore` strips
only its dev-only `showcase/`. Overwriting it can never change plugin behaviour
- the `loader.php` "highest version wins" negotiation picks the newest copy
across every active plugin, and a second copy is inert.

The version passed to `Perxel_UI_Loader::register()` in the main file **and** the
`vendor/perxel-ui/` contents must match the tag you vendored. Update both when
you run `bin/update-ui.sh`.

We host the kit's component showcase as a hidden maintainer-only screen
(`PERXEL_UI_SHOWCASE_HOSTED` + `Admin::can_see_showcase()`), so its own Tools
page is suppressed.

## Before committing

```bash
php -l <changed files>
composer run lint          # phpcs - must stay green
composer run build         # bin/build-zip.sh - installable zip in dist/
bin/plugin-check.sh        # official Plugin Check, same as CI (needs wp-cli +
                           #   `wp package install wordpress/plugin-check-cli`)
```

`phpcs.xml.dist` curates the base `WordPress` standard: a terse-docblock house
style, and `PrefixAllGlobals` is told about both the plugin prefix and the
kit's (`perxel_ui` / `PERXEL_UI` / `Perxel_UI` / `pxui`). CI also runs the
official **Plugin Check** action against the built zip (not the raw checkout).

There are no automated tests and no WP in the lint environment - `phpcs` and
`php -l` verify syntax and style only. Behaviour must be smoke-tested on a real
WordPress site.

## WordPress.org / Plugin Check compliance

Rules that are not obvious and cost real time when re-derived per plugin:

| Rule | Why |
|---|---|
| Namespace root = slug in `Ucfirst_Snake` (`Perxel_Example`) | `PrefixAllGlobals` accepts it as the prefix; a `Vendor\Package` namespace is flagged (`NonPrefixedNamespaceFound`) and Plugin Check ignores the `phpcs.xml.dist` prefix list |
| Custom-table names via `%i`, never string-concatenated | `WordPress.DB.PreparedSQL.NotPrepared` is **error-level** and blocks .org (see "Custom tables") |
| No `load_plugin_textdomain()` | .org auto-loads translations (slug == text domain); calling it on `plugins_loaded` is "too early" on WP 6.7+ |
| Prefix any variable you **assign** in a view (`$pxex_url`); vars passed in via `extract()` are fine | `NonPrefixedVariableFound` fires on template-scope assignments |
| `set_time_limit()` etc.: `function_exists()` guard + inline `// phpcs:ignore Squiz.PHP.DiscouragedFunctions.Discouraged -- <reason>` | discouraged-function warning |
| Calling another plugin's hooks (WPML `wpml_*`, WooCommerce): scope a `phpcs.xml.dist` exclude to the wrapper file **and** add the code to `lint.yml` -> `ignore-codes` | `NonPrefixedHooknameFound`; the two tools don't share config |
| `'suppress_filters' => true` in a query: same dual-suppression, code `WordPressVIPMinimum.Performance.WPQueryParams.SuppressFilters_suppress_filters` | deliberate but flagged |

The split that bites: **Plugin Check runs its own ruleset, not `phpcs.xml.dist`.**
Any suppression for a documented false positive goes in *both* places -
`phpcs.xml.dist` (for `composer run lint`) and `lint.yml` -> `ignore-codes`
(mirrored by `bin/plugin-check.sh`).

## Releasing

1. Bump the version in `perxel-example.php` (header + `PXEX_VERSION`) and
   `readme.txt` (`Stable tag`); add a changelog entry to both `readme.txt` and
   `CHANGELOG.md`. Merge to `main` first. Tag, plugin `Version:` and `Stable tag`
   must all be equal or the deploy fails before touching SVN.
2. Create the tag on `main` and publish a GitHub Release. `release.yml`'s `zip`
   job attaches `perxel-example.zip`; the `deploy` job commits trunk +
   `tags/<version>` + `.wordpress-org/` (-> SVN `assets/`) with the SHA-pinned
   10up action. It only runs when the repo variable `DEPLOY_TO_WPORG` is `true`.
3. Verify `https://wordpress.org/plugins/<slug>/` and
   `https://api.wordpress.org/plugins/info/1.0/<slug>.json` show the new version.
   Assets can 404 on `ps.w.org` for a while after the first commit (CDN lag).

### First release of a new plugin (the only manual bit is the review)

1. Upload `dist/<slug>.zip` at <https://wordpress.org/plugins/developers/add/>.
   No SVN repo exists until the review team approves it.
2. Secrets `SVN_USERNAME` / `SVN_PASSWORD`: set once as **org** secrets and grant
   this repo access (org -> Settings -> Secrets -> Repository access). Use an
   SVN-specific password if the wordpress.org profile offers one. Never paste it
   in chat or commit it.
3. Once approved: set the repo variable `DEPLOY_TO_WPORG=true`, run **Actions ->
   Release -> Run workflow** with the tag and `dry_run` on (default) to check the
   staging without committing, then publish the Release. The very first version
   deploys the same way as every later one - no manual SVN commit.
4. If automation ever breaks, plain `svn` works: check out
   `https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/<slug>`, copy the `.distignore`-filtered
   build into `trunk/`, `.wordpress-org/*` into `assets/`, `svn cp trunk
   tags/<version>`, `svn ci`.

Notes: a large first commit (hundreds of vendored files) sits on "Committing
transaction..." for minutes - normal. The action strips the `v` from a `vX.Y.Z`
tag itself; on a manual run it can't, hence the explicit `VERSION`. Do not bump
versions, tag or publish releases without the maintainer asking.

Build artifacts (`dist/`) are never committed.
